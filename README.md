üìù TO-DO App API (Go + Gin + JWT)

This is a mock back-end REST API for managing to-do lists and their steps. Authentication is handled using JWT tokens. No real database is used ‚Äî all data is stored in memory.

The deployment is done in railway. The base URL will be `https://go-restapi-todo-production.up.railway.app` for remote access

The base in localhost will be `http://localhost:8080` if no configuration is done.
